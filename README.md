# ‚úàÔ∏è Airport Delay Analysis Dashboard - Power BI

This project is an interactive **Power BI dashboard** that analyzes flight delay data across various U.S. airports. It provides clear insights into the reasons behind delays, their distribution over time, and airline-level performance.

## üìä Dashboard Overview

The report consists of multiple visual components:

- **Delay Reasons Breakdown**  
  Shows the percentage contribution of each delay cause:
  - Carrier Delay: 7.15%
  - NAS Delay: 12.10%
  - Late Aircraft Delay: 28.83%
  - Weather & Security Delay: <1%
  - Others: 51.32%

- **Total Delay by Airport**  
  Highlights top airports with the most total delay minutes.  
  Example: Hartsfield‚ÄìJackson Atlanta International Airport: **33.6K minutes**

- **Delays by Day of the Week**  
  Sunday shows the highest total delay (~18.5K minutes), followed by Friday.

- **Monthly Flight Volume vs Delay Time**  
  December has the highest number of flights and total delays.

- **Carrier-wise Filtering**  
  Dynamic filter to analyze delay patterns by airline.
