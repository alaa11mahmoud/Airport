# ‚úàÔ∏è Airport Delay Analysis Dashboard - Power BI

This project is an interactive **Power BI dashboard** that analyzes flight delay data across various U.S. airports. It provides clear insights into the reasons behind delays, their distribution over time, and airline-level performance.

---

## üìä Dashboard Overview

The report consists of multiple visual components:

- **Delay Reasons Breakdown**  
  Shows the percentage contribution of each delay cause:
  - Carrier Delay: 7.15%
  - NAS Delay: 12.10%
  - Late Aircraft Delay: 28.83%
  - Weather & Security Delay: <1%
  - Others: 51.32%

- **Total Delay by Airport**  
  Highlights top airports with the most total delay minutes.  
  Example: Hartsfield‚ÄìJackson Atlanta International Airport: **33.6K minutes**

- **Delays by Day of the Week**  
  Sunday shows the highest total delay (~18.5K minutes), followed by Friday.

- **Monthly Flight Volume vs Delay Time**  
  December has the highest number of flights and total delays.

- **Carrier-wise Filtering**  
  Dynamic filter to analyze delay patterns by airline.

## Project Steps
### Here‚Äôs a breakdown of how the project was built:

### 1 Data Source Preparation
Imported raw flight delay data from Excel into Power BI.

### 2 Data Modeling
Created the following dimensional tables:

Airport Dim: Contains airport names and details.
Carriers Dim: Contains airline/carrier names and codes.
Date Dim: Created using DAX to enable time-based analysis.
Built a Fact Table for flight delay records with relationships to all dimensions.

### 3 Data Transformation & DAX Calculations
Cleaned and structured the data using Power Query.

### 4 Created calculated columns and measures, including:
TotalMinutes_Late
Delay categories (Carrier, NAS, Weather, etc.)
Delay % by reason
On-time vs late flight percentage

### 5 Dashboard Design & Visualization
Designed a user-friendly dashboard using slicers, KPIs, and charts.
Added filters by carrier, airport, and date to enhance interactivity.

### 5 Insights Extraction
Identified top airports, peak delay days, and high-delay carriers.
Analyzed seasonal and weekly delay trends.
